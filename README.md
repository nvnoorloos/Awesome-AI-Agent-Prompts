# Awesome-AI-Agent-Prompts
A collection of prompts, instructions and Agent system prompts for AI (Agents)

## Directories
- `prompts` can be used or referenced when starting a new conversation with an AI (Agent)
- `instructions` contains AGENTS.md style files (https://agents.md/) for AI Agents
- `chatmodes` can be used to define custom AI Agents for a specific task

## Spec-Driven Development with Kiro
The `kiro-workflow` prompt mimics the Workflow that is used by the Kiro IDE (https://kiro.dev)

- It starts with creating your `requirements.md`
- After your requirements are fine, the `design.md` is being created
- When the design is approved it will generate the `tasks.md` and you can start with the execution of each task

_If you want to continue the Kiro workflow in a brand new AI Agent session: just copy/paste or reference the prompt again, it will detect existing features to continue or you can design a brand new one!_
